tips on this fictional studio website# j360-final-project

1. I came up with this name "beez" for my studio name, because my last name pronounces like "bee" in Chinese.

2. Inspired by the "bee", as you can see, I created my website homepage like an honeycomb. I think it looks great.
   I put a collection of eastern culture on the homepage. Also, three different colorful (blue, grey, and red) "combs" with memos link to about.html, work.html and news.html.

3. I had read many books and websites when making this project, thank to the book http://www.javascriptbook.com/about/ and http://stackoverflow.com/.

4. shout out to my friends http://www.aoyangxun.com and https://dribbble.com/levimcg to make me publish their works (illustrators and photographs) on my pages, thank to the free photos from foter.com.+twitter.com.  

5. Besides the works from my friends, the other works (logo, posters, websites, and photos, etc) were created or made by myself. On the work page, the "honeycomb" links to shop.html, planner.html, and website (urls) I created in this semester, just click them to see the functions.

6. 7 html documents were created in this project--home, work, about, news, contact, shop, and planner.

7. I put all the CSS selectors into one file, so the document shows long and large-sized.

8. Since it is a business studio, the website is created to promote the business. A favicon is a good way to achieve this. I referred the http://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_link_sizes.asp and it works in my website.

9. thoughts: never stop learning!
